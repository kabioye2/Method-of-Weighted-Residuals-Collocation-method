# Method-of-Weighted-Residuals-Collocation-method

The conservation balance of a species that diffuses and reacts is a partial differential equation,
Where c is concentration, t is time, r is radial coordinate and ϕ is the Thiele modulus. This
equation will be used throughout this assignment to solve for the unknown concentrations by
using Lagrange polynomials with collocation. The concentrations were found using the “\”
command and plotted. The residuals and analytical solution were also plotted.

Conclusion
The collocation method used Lagrangian polynomials to solve for the conservation balance of
species equation to find the unknown concentrations. Using the standard matric form, which has
been seen many times, and the knowledge obtained from solving for system of equations, we
were able to find the unknown con entrations.

Discussion
The collocation method is good for solving for partial differential functions, just like equation 1.
This assignment was effective in teaching how the collocation method works.
